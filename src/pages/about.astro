              Reaching the peak of the mountain, the "fjelltopp", is hard work.
              It requires navigation, problem solving, determination, mental and
              physical stamina. Itâ€™s easier to navigate around the mountain, but
              we want to reach the top, to get the best view, to reveal new
              challenges and to and understand the landscape around us.
            </p>
