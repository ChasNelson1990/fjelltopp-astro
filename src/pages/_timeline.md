  - "<h2>Our experience</h2>\r\nWe believe in the power of open-source platforms: no license fees, easy collaboration, and open innovation. We are always looking for ways to partner with local engineers and grow their capacity to work with open-source platforms. Our aim is to help those with limited experience working with popular technologies such as Linux, Python and Docker.\r\n\r\nWe pick up new technologies quickly but have particular experience in working with: Open Data Kit, DHIS2, OpenMRS, CKAN, Superset, Microsoft PowerBI, Linux, Python, Java, Kubernetes, Docker, SQL, Amazon Web Services, NGINX, Javascript, React, NextJS, and HTML/CSS.\r\n\r\nDuring our first year we delivered services totalling $200,000 to new clients in the Ukraine, Madagascar, Jordan, Central African Republic, Egypt, Switzerland and Finland, some of which was won by competitive tender. In recognition of this, Fjelltopp Ltd was selected as best \"Newcomer to International Trade\" at the International Trade Club awards.\r\n\r\nRead our UNAIDS Case Study and WHO Ukraine Case Study to find out more about how we work to solve problems for our clients."

It is so important to identify individuals bitten by at-risk animals and to treat them early - before symptoms appear. Fjelltopp has supported the University Glasgow to implement a platform for animal-to-human contact tracing within a DHIS2 instance.  Starting from bite records kept by health facilities, investigators identify at-risk animals and look for others that may have also been bitten by the animal. \r\n \r\nFjelltopp has also offered support for the research group's Integrated Bite Case Management (IBCM) platform, previously implemented using a custom solution. This electronic surveillance tool records detailed information about bites in order to identify potential risk. Fjeltopp have been working to ensure the long term stability of the platform.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"button\" href=\"/project/university-of-glasgow-digital-monitoring-of-rabies-risk-cases-across-species/\">Find out more</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Fjelltopp took a lead on the project's statistical design and analysis, as well as the final report writing.\r\n\r\nIn total, 433 participants contributed to the the final results which revealed that women: still carry the most household responsibility in Kazakhstan, were less likely to isolate whilst working on the pandemic frontline, more susceptible to emotional exhaustion and burnout, and saw the most acute increase in workplace violence during the pandemic.  This led rise to a number of recommendations for the national health system. The report has been published by the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/26-01-2023-female-health-care-workers-and-covid-19-in-kazakhstan--study-unveils-long-standing-need-for-gender-responsive-policies\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.
