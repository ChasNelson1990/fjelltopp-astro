  - "<h3>When and why did you join Fjelltopp?</h3>\r\n\r\nI joined as a founding member after having worked on public health surveillance projects with the WHO since 2014. I found the work interesting and meaningful, so founding Fjelltopp together with the rest of the team was a great way to ensure we could continue to work on our existing projects and find new, impactful work.\r\n\r\n<h3>What strengths do you bring to Fjelltopp?</h3>\r\n\r\nI hold a PhD in physics from Durham University and an MSc in epidemiology from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. I have broad technical and IT experience and significant experience with public health surveillance, epidemiology and infectious disease modelling.\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s most important to you about working at Fjelltopp?</h3>\r\n\r\nTo me, the most important thing is doing interesting work that is meaningful and can make a real difference.\r\n\r\n<h3>What values are most important to you?</h3>\r\n\r\n<strong>Curiosity.</strong> A genuine curiosity about people, systems and physical phenomena underlies most of my work. I want to investigate and find out how things work and how they can be improved.\r\n\r\n<strong>Equality.</strong> Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and empathy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Evidence-based work.</strong> I believe all important work should be based on the best available scientific evidence."
