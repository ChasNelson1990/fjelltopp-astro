  - "<h3>When and why did you join Fjelltopp?</h3>\r\nI joined Fjelltopp in 2022. I was attracted to the flexibility of the work, as well as the chance to work alongside a vastly experienced team. When I joined, I supported and maintained the Country Electronic Disease Surveillance system that was designed and implemented by the Fjelltopp team.\r\n<h3>What strengths do you bring to Fjelltopp?</h3>\r\nI hold a master’s in computer science, and I have experience in working in the field of public health for over 8 years, both with the Ministry of Health and WHO Madagascar.\r\n\r\nI also have experience with the Health Information System (HIS) in Madagascar, working on immunisation, disease surveillance and response programs. I have also been part of a team of facilitators delivering training to over a thousand MoH staff at various levels.\r\n<h3>What’s most important to you about working at Fjelltopp?</h3>\r\nI have always tried to make my work make positive impacts, and at Fjelltopp, I can make that impact on an international scale. The work I do here either supports, simplifies or improves the job of our clients and that’s what’s important to me.\r\n<h3>What values are most important to you?</h3>\r\n<strong>Sharing knowledge.</strong> Knowledge is the most powerful asset we have in the world. Sharing it freely only makes us all stronger.\r\n\r\n<strong>Teamwork.</strong> Only unity, working together towards a common goal can bring great results.\r\n\r\n<strong>Persistence.</strong> Never give in!"
