    - "<h3>When and why did you join Fjelltopp?</h3>\r\nI’m one of the founding members. I started working for the team in 2017 as a developer for the Somalia Public Health Surveillance project. In 2018, we founded Fjelltopp. My personal reasons for founding the company are that I can do what I enjoy (build excellent software) and contribute to causes I feel strongly about (The well-being of people all over the world).\r\n<h3>What strengths do you bring to Fjelltopp?</h3>\r\nI have a wealth of prior experience in software engineering and project management. I’m Chief Technical Officer, so I play a leadership role in designing the architecture of our systems, software development culture and setting up best practices for the technical work.\r\n<h3>What’s most important to you about working at Fjelltopp?</h3>\r\nSoftware is a powerful tool, it can be used as leverage for people’s actions. By taking care of software excellence at Fjelltopp I can help in maximising the impact of clients’ actions by helping them with health data harmonization.\r\n<h3>What values are most important to you?</h3>\r\n<strong>Efficiency.</strong> I really enjoy designing and building solutions which make problems easier to solve. Fjelltopp not only gives me opportunities to excel at software development but also to improve social wellbeing by working on high impact projects across the globe.\r\n\r\n<strong>Collaboration.</strong> I enjoy working with others and I strongly believe that the team effort is much more effective than the individual. Every project has a human element to it, both internally through team members or clients and externally, through end-users and other beneficiaries. In my opinion, human interaction is the foundation of the company’s success."
