    - "<h3>When and why did you join Fjelltopp?</h3>\r\nI first partnered with the Fjelltopp team as an Associate Data Scientist in 2020, whilst I was still working as a Research Fellow at the University of Glasgow (UK) developing data science technologies for biomedical research. I continued to work with Fjelltopp whilst CTO of another company, a spin-out from Durham University, that was building a platform for developing, deploying and evaluating AI models for medical problems. Eventually I joined Fjelltopp full-time in 2023 and became a Director in 2024. Over my career I've discovered that what I’m really passionate about is using data for public good and that's what's brought me more and more onboard with the mission we have at Fjelltopp.\r\n<h3>What strengths do you bring to Fjelltopp?</h3>\r\nMy background is a somewhat unique blend of life sciences (biology and medicine) and computing sciences (data sciences with some engineering thrown in). This gives me a slightly unusual set of skills (qualitative and quantitative research skills, understanding a broad range of different statistical approaches, appreciating the biological/medical elements). When combined with a geekiness about data (and coffee), I can support the Fjelltopp team with some of our clients more complex data science, AI and statistics challenges and ensure we deliver great analyses as part of our offering.\r\n<h3>What’s most important to you about working at Fjelltopp?</h3>\r\nEverything Fjelltopp does is about having an impact. It’s about removing the complexities of data engineering and data science for those people trying to drive change in society, healthcare and beyond – we do what we’re good at, so they can do what they’re good at.\r\n<h3>What values are most important to you?</h3>\r\n<strong>Openness.</strong> We’re open and honest with each other, also our code is open-source and available to anyone, that’s really important.\r\n\r\n<strong>Trust.</strong> It’s important that we put our trust in our data and our trust in each other.\r\n\r\n<strong>Diversity.</strong> Again, this value is important in terms of our data and our people. We must work with diverse groups of people and keep diversity in our data if we are going to reach our goals."
