## Key Collaborative Projects

Our discussions were focused upon two major initiatives that we are collaborating upon:

- **The WHO AFRO Data Hub |** This project seeks to revolutionise health data management across African member states by employing advanced data integration and visualisation technologies. It aims at fostering data sustainability and enhancing the operational effectiveness of health interventions.
- **National Research Repository for Zambia |** This UNICEF funded initiative endeavours to construct a digital repository to facilitate the improved accessibility and utility of research findings. It is characterised by its emphasis on stakeholder engagement, capacity enhancement, and a structured implementation plan, all underpinned by open-source technology.

## Inspiration from Helsinki’s Technological and Sustainable Landscape

The Helsinki summit agenda was structured to blend focussed work sessions with cultural engagements. This enabled us to build a stronger sense of team and also create space for creativity. Our strategic discussions took place at the [Oodi Central Library](https://oodihelsinki.fi/en/), an icon of modern architecture and innovation in Helsinki. Oodi’s dynamic environment supported our focus on key projects like the WHO Afro Data Hub and the UNICEF Zambia Research Repository, offering spaces that inspired creativity and collaboration. Alongside our meetings, we immersed ourselves in Helsinki’s culture, visiting the [Ryoji Ikeda exhibition at Amos Rex](https://amosrex.fi/en/), enjoying a [traditional Finnish sauna](https://www.loylyhelsinki.fi/en), and dining at sustainability-focused restaurants. This blend of productivity and local exploration fostered a unique and fruitful dialogue, underlining the summit’s success.

Here is a brief summary of our discussions during the summit:

- We met with technical staff from WHO Geneva to learn more about the WHO Global Health Data Hub.
- We discussed the methodology for conducting a needs assessment for the Zambia Research Repository.
- We explored creative ways to improve our software solutions, including ideas using generative AI and a more reactive web design.
- We reviewed the [COAR Community Framework for Good Practices in Repositories](https://www.coar-repositories.org/coar-community-framework-for-good-practices-in-repositories/) and a strategy to deliver all essential features through our CKAN projects.
- We shared strategic ideas of finding and winning new consulting work within our sector of international development and public health
