At Fjelltopp, our mission to harmonise the world’s public data aligns deeply with the [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) As Global Goals Week highlights the progress being made towards achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we take this opportunity to reflect on how our work directly contributes to several key SDGs, particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

## SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being

Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all is central to both SDG 3 and Fjelltopp’s work. Our efforts in public health surveillance and data integration help nations around the world monitor disease outbreaks, improve health system responses, and ultimately, save lives.

Fjelltopp has played a role in supporting the World Health Organization (WHO) African Regional Office and UNAIDS, amongst others, through innovative data integration initiatives.

In collaboration with UNAIDS, Fjelltopp has supported the development of the UNAIDS AIDS Data Repository. This project focuses on integrating HIV/AIDS data from multiple countries to create a comprehensive platform for global HIV/AIDS information. By leveraging open-source technologies, Fjelltopp has enabled UNAIDS to harmonise data from numerous partners, making it easier for policymakers, researchers, and public health professionals to access and analyse data. This integrated repository has been vital in estimating the progress of HIV/AIDS interventions globally, facilitating better-targeted strategies and more informed modelling and policy decisions.

The impact of our work is felt especially in low- and middle-income countries, where access to robust health infrastructure is often limited. By creating affordable, scalable solutions, we help bridge gaps in healthcare data, empowering governments to make informed, timely decisions that improve health outcomes for their populations.

## SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

Achieving the SDGs is only possible through collaboration and strong partnerships, as emphasised in SDG 17. At Fjelltopp, we pride ourselves on our partnerships with international organisations such as the WHO, FAO, UNICEF, and UNAIDS, as well as local Ministries.

These collaborations enable us to provide tailored, context-specific solutions that are sensitive to the unique challenges each country faces. By working closely with local professionals, we ensure that our systems are not only technically robust but also culturally appropriate and sustainable. Our focus on training and mentorship ensures that local teams can maintain and enhance the systems we help them build, promoting long-term sustainability beyond our initial involvement.

## Open-Source Technology for Global Good

One of Fjelltopp’s core values is openness. Almost all of our solutions are built on open-source technologies, ensuring that our tools can be freely accessed and adapted by anyone who needs them.

This commitment aligns with SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) by making cutting-edge technologies available to the world’s poorest countries without the burden of expensive licensing fees.

By fostering an ecosystem of openness, we contribute to a more equitable global data landscape, where every country, regardless of income level, can harness the power of data to improve public outcomes.

## Looking Ahead: Our Commitment to the SDGs

As Global Goals Week celebrates progress towards a more sustainable, equitable future, Fjelltopp reaffirms our commitment to advancing the SDGs. Whether it’s supporting case-based health surveillance or promoting interoperability between data systems, every project we undertake is a step towards a world where data works for everyone.

The road to achieving the SDGs is long and filled with challenges, but at Fjelltopp, we believe that by striving for the “fjelltopp”—the mountaintop—we can help create a healthier, more just world for all. Together with our partners, we are proud to contribute to a global movement that prioritises well-being, collaboration, and equality, ensuring that no one is left behind.
