## Expert data management and analysis for your public health research project

Research institutions around the world are conducting studies to support and strengthen evidence-based decision making in the public health sector. Such studies often involve the collection, management and analysis of large complex datasets from patients and healthcare staff.

Fjelltopp provides expertise in electronic data collection, analysis and research that supports public health research and analysis. We collect data using open-source survey tools (such as Kobo Toolbox), and then clean, profile and analyse the data with custom versioned software code (using the Python/R Anaconda framework) to create familiar outputs in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

Our approach ensures best practices in data management are followed throughout the research project, meaning the analysis will be easily repeatable, auditable, organised and completely secure which is vital in a public health study.
