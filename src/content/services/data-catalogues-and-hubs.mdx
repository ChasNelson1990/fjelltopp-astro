## Take control of your data distribution with a health data catalogue

Ministries of health are responsible for vast amounts of data to which a multitude of stakeholders must have access. These data sets must be stored in a secure centre with the necessary means to control access, dissemination, interoperability, etc.

Using data catalogues for healthcare saves time and money, and can drive innovation and productivity for both staff and external partners. We have experience and expertise in using CKAN to provide data catalogues to a wide range of users. CKAN is a feature-rich, open-source tool used by governments worldwide to support data management and dissemination.

        <h3>Findable</h3>
        <p>Store and organise your data in an online backed-up catalogue. Search and filter the catalogue to find data and documentation of interest. Preview and query structured datasets to gain deeper insight.</p>

        <h3>Accessible</h3>
        <p>Control precisely which individuals and organisations can access your data and metadata. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit, meaning it is much more secure than typical email distribution methods.</p>

        <h3>Interoperable</h3>
        <p>Safely allow third-parties to configure programmatic access to your data e.g. for automated data refreshing or system interoperability. Everything a user can do, a programme can do (and more) via the API.</p>
    </li>

        <h3>Reusable</h3>
        <p>Create and manage metadata, including data dictionaries, or source information. Version and change track everything. Sign up to notifications when data and documentation is updated.</p>

## Who are health data catalogues for?

Data catalogues are an asset to organisations that need help consolidating multiple streams of data. Here are some examples:

- Governments
- Ministries of Health
- Divisions of the United Nations
- Programmes of the United Nations
- NGOs

## How to proceed with a health data catalogue

- Make an appointment for a free consultation to discuss the issues we can solve for you.
- We develop a work plan and budget tailored to your needs, then get to work providing technical solutions and support.
- We draw up a basic implementation of the system, review it with you and develop it to ensure it meets all your requirements.
- We maintain constant consultation and communication. We adapt to all the changes that occur, and we keep you informed of the evolution of the situation.
- Once the system is approved, we help with maintenance and hosting. A centralised issue tracking system reports and responds to bugs or urgent priority system changes.
- We work with a designated member of your organisation's technical staff. We offer training and development to ensure a smooth transfer to your staff on an agreed date.

## What you get with our health data catalogue support

- Complete analysis of your needs, including full documentation and professional writing.
- A fully hosted and maintained online document and data centre customised to your organisation's branding.
- Development of any functionality appropriate to your needs, including evaluation of any additional functionality and enhancements after implementation.
- Assistance with implementing the platform, including help migrating your data into the new system.
- Ongoing training and development of your team to support future maintenance and hosting as needed.
