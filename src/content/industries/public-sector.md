Our work in the public sector spans project management, document management, and data repositories. We provide expertise in electronic data collection, data analysis, and research that supports public sector data research and analysis, always ensuring the projects align with national policies and objectives.

We have worked with government ministries and consultants across Europe, Africa, and Asia, providing expertise in electronic data collection, analysis, and research that supports public sector projects. We collect data using open-source survey tools (such as [Kobo Toolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) or [ODK](getodk.org)), and then clean, profile, and analyse the data with custom-versioned software code (using the Python/R framework) to create familiar outputs in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or custom databases.

Our approach ensures best practices in data management are followed throughout the research project, meaning the analysis will be easily repeatable, auditable, organised, and completely secure â€“ which are vital to support and strengthen evidence-based decision making across the public sector.

- **Open Source and Interoperable Solutions** We deliver cost-effective and flexible software solutions tailored to public sector needs, promoting transparency and efficiency. Everything we do is open source and interoperable.
- **Document Management and Data Repositories** Experts in developing systems for managing large datasets and documents, having produced these for government ministries across Europe and Africa.
- **Sustainability and Capacity Building** We prioritise the development of local capacity and sustainable systems, focusing on reducing dependency on external service providers and building local resilience.
- **Global Reach, Local Impact** We have a network of consultants across Europe, Africa, and Asia, which we leverage to ensure that local context is always considered and respected while maintaining global standards.

## Who do we work with in the public sector?

We have experience working with a number of public sector organisations, developing systems for managing large datasets and documents. We have worked with the Malawi Ministry and Health on a document management system, and with the Zambian Ministry of Finance and National Planning on an evaluation and research repository.

Any public sector organisation that aspires to be truly data-driven can benefit from our technical expertise and software offering.

## How can our public sector industry expertise help your organisation?

Our years of experience working with public sector organisations mean that we have the industry knowledge, expertise, and insight required for your projects. But we also have the tools, software, and systems; the research and analysis skills; and the experience of working with diverse groups of collaborators, which makes us particularly well-versed in bridging the gap between technology and non-technical users.

The support we provide on top of our expertise encompasses consultative project management, ensuring alignment with national policies and objectives; using our network of consultants across three continents, always respecting local context; and ensuring training and development for your staff.
