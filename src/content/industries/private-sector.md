At Fjelltopp we appreciate the power that private sector has to innovate and innovate fast. We particularly enjoy partnering with mission-driven organisations (like ourselves) who have been founded to solve a specific problem, defined by their mission.

Our work with mission-driven enterprises is closely tied to our own principles of ethical business and social mission before profit. We work with these companies to provide them with the tools needed to manage and leverage data effectively, fostering transparency and accountability.

Our offering covers consultative project management, and document management and data repositories. We provide expertise in electronic data collection, analysis, and research that supports mission-driven data projects. Everything we offer is aligned with the Principles for Digital Development, and geared towards enabling these companies to focus on their core mission.

We work to make sure solutions are bespoke, customisable, and able to grow with the organisation, and offer training and support so that the data systems can be managed and maintained independently. Our goal is to make it easier for you to achieve yours.

- **Ethical and Sustainable Practices** We are committed to ethical business practices, reinvesting profits into social causes, and adhering to the Principles for Digital Development.
- **Capacity Building and Support** We offer training and ongoing support, so mission-driven enterprises can independently manage and maintain their data systems.
- **Customisable Open-Source Technologies** Using platforms like CKAN, we deliver customisable solutions that can grow with your organisation, avoiding vendor lock-in and ensuring long-term viability.
- **Collaboration and Community Engagement** Engaging with mission-driven enterprises to co-create solutions, we foster a community around shared values of sustainability and social equity.

## Who do we work with in the mission-driven enterprises sector?

We have experience working with start-ups, micro-companies, and businesses across the UK, EU, US and beyond who are either working to meet any of the sustainable development goals or who use data and technology to improve people’s lives, whether in their local area or globally.

Any mission-driven enterprises that aspires to be truly data-driven can benefit from our technical expertise and software offering. We can provide the tools needed to manage data effectively, ensuring the transparency and accountability that are key in this sector.

## How can our mission-driven enterprises industry expertise help your organisation?

Our shared values and ethical business principles mean that we already understand the baseline of the work of mission-driven enterprises. And our years of experience working with public health and public sector organisations mean that we have the industry knowledge and expertise; the tools, software, and systems; and the research and analysis skills that can benefit companies in this sector. We also have the experience of working with diverse groups of collaborators, which makes us particularly well-versed in bridging the gap between technology and non-technical users.

The training and support we provide on top of this expertise means that mission-driven enterprises can independently manage and maintain their data systems, grow their organisation confident in the systems’ long-term viability, and be free to focus on their own work and mission securely.
