Our work has encompassed projects in Tanzania, the Philippines, Madagascar, and Central African Republic, experience working with the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO), and a network of consultants across Europe, Africa, and Asia. We work to ensure that local context is always considered and respected alongside the global standards maintained in all our work.

We bring our expertise in data catalogues, research and analysis support, open-source survey tools, and custom-versioned software code and apply it to data in international development â€“ a field we know very well.
