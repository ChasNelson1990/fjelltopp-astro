Since Fjelltopp’s inception, we have been at the forefront of public health innovation. We have worked on data catalogues and research and analysis support projects for governments, United Nations agencies, universities, and NGOs. We have also developed real-time epidemiological surveillance systems for disease control and emergency response in Tanzania, the Philippines, Madagascar, and Central African Republic.

Our work in this industry encompasses data catalogues for health, public health research and analysis support, and support with both CKAN and DHIS2, using open-source survey tools (such as [Kobo Toolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) or [ODK](getodk.org)) and custom-versioned software code (using the Python/R framework) to create familiar outputs in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or custom databases.

We believe that streamlining and consolidating the world’s public health data means better decisions can be made for better health across the world.

- **Health Data Integration** We are experts in harmonising and managing health data, particularly across low- and middle-income countries, using open-source platforms like CKAN.
- **Health Surveillance Systems** Experienced in developing real-time public health surveillance systems, providing essential tools for epidemic preparedness, and outbreak monitoring and response.
- **Capacity Building and Training** We offer training programmes for in-country health and IT professionals, ensuring sustainable development and local ownership of health information systems.
- **Data-Driven Decisions** Supporting Ministries of Health and international organisations with data analytics and visualisation tools to enhance policy-making and programme implementation.

## Who do we work with in the public health industry?

We have experience working with a number of major health organisations. We are trusted by UNAIDS, the WHO, and UNICEF, having worked on projects like the AIDS Data Repository and public health surveillance systems.

Any health organisation that aspires to be truly data-driven can benefit from our technical expertise and software offering.

## How can our public health industry expertise help your organisation?

Our years of experience working with public health organisations mean that we have the industry knowledge, expertise, and insight required for your projects. But we also have the tools, software, and systems; the research and analysis skills; and the experience of working with diverse groups of collaborators, which makes us particularly well-versed in bridging the gap between technology and non-technical users.

The support we provide on top of our expertise encompasses training and assistance with open-source platforms like CKAN and DHIS2; maintenance and hosting of custom systems; a centralised issue-tracking system; and working with a designated member of your organisation’s technical staff, ensuring training and development for your team.
